# TODO List 

# High Priority 

- Add instant results for: 
    - Sports 
    - Recipes  
    - DuckDuckHack cheat sheet integrations 

- Integrate results for: 
    - Shopping 


- Allow criteria selection for users to filter their results 

# Medium Priority 

- Make a dynamic language change on the search results based on 
the language that their search was in. e.g: if some searches something in
 spanish it will give them the Spanish sidebar. 

- Add instant results for: 
    - 2d and 3d graphs 
    - Restaurant menus (and number and address and hours)
    - Music Lyrics (and embedded songs)

- Make the "Make us your default search engine" button do 1 click setups
instead of just taking people to instructions

# Low Priority

- Add a book tab 
- Make our own api for displaying website favicons
- Add a second page to the results page 
- Add qr code instant results 

- Cleanup the code  because it is starting to get messy.

# Issues
- The Spanish and German version of this site was translated by Bing 
and probably have grammatical errors.
